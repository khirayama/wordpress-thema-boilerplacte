# WordPress Boilerplate

## Get started

For now, I want to run application, you do following.

```sh
$ composer install
# Set up wp-config.php
$ composer run-script server # Access http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

if you haven't install `composer`, you can get it using `brew`.

```sh
$ brew install homebrew/php/composer
```

## Development

```sh
$ composer install
$ npm install
# Set up wp-config.php
$ npm run dev
# Access http://0.0.0.0:5000
```
